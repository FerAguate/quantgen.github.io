**Genomic Analysis and Prediction of Complex Traits**. Development and evaluation of methods and software for analysis and prediction of complex traits using high-dimensional genomic data (e.g., SNPs, Gentoyping-by-sequencing, and other types of sequence data). Our research in this area has focused on the use of shrinkage and variable selection parameteric model as well as in the use of some semi-parameteric methods (e.g., RKHS).

**Genomic x Environment**. Development methods for integrating in a unified framework high-dimensional genomic and environmental data. We have develop methods that can model interactions between high dimensional marker panels and high-dimensional evironmental covariates. These methods were originally developed and tested with data from wheat trails. We are currently extending some of these mehthos for analysis of complex human traits and diseases.

**Integration of data from multiple omic layers**. Development of models and software for integrating high dimensional multi-layer omic data. Our focus is on methods that can integrate whole-omic profiles and can model interactions between two or more high dimensional predictor sets (e.g., genome-by-methylome interactions). We are currently working on using these methods for prediction of breast cancer outcomes and in plant omic applications.

**Software development for analysis of big omic data**. We have developed several R-packages for genetic analysis using pedigrees, genomes and other omics (see software below for further details).

**Genomic Analysis of Obesity and Response to Excercise**. We maintain an active collaboration with researchers from the [TIGER](http://tigerstudy.org/) study...
