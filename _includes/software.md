**BGLR**. The Bayesian Generalized Linear Regression R package implements a variety of shrinkage and variable selection methods. The package can be used with whole-genome data (e.g., SNPs, gene expression or other omics), pedigrees and non-genetic covariates, including high-dimensional environmental data.
